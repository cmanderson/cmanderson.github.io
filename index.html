            <p>I'm a junior studying Computer Science at Cornell.
            My academic interests are mainly in AI and machine learning, as well as programming languages.
            This page is under construction while I write a better bio and learn how to do CSS.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I currently work as a programmer for the <a href="http://violet.cusat.cornell.edu/">Violet Satellite Project</a>.
            Violet is a satellite built by Cornell students to test control moment gyroscope (CMG) steering laws,
            currently scheduled to launch in 2015.
            My work has mainly consisted of writing low-level flight software in C.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In my free time, I am the secretary of <a href="http://cornellmafiaclub.github.io/">Mafia Club</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At Big Red Hacks, Cornell's first major hackathon which took place in October 2014, I was part of a team
            which created two projects:
            <a href="http://ec2-54-69-108-70.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/">an\note</a>, a note-taking web app designed for math and engineering courses,
            on github <a href="https://github.com/ofpach513/Notificatr">here</a>;
            and <a href="fedorify.me">Fedorify</a>, a joke project that uses face recognition to make people in photos wear fedoras,
            on github <a href="https://github.com/GriffinBrodman/FedorasAsAService">here</a>.
